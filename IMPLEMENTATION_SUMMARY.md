# Lineae Implementation Summary

This Python implementation of the Lineae board game includes all requested features:

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Core Game Implementation
- Full game rules implementation based on `lineae_rules.txt`
- 8x10 board with ocean spaces, submersibles, rockets, and mineral deposits
- Complete player management (workers, resources, money, electricity, VP)
- All game actions: worker placement, submersible movement, rocket loading, etc.
- Proper game flow: Sunlight → Action → Cleanup phases

### 2. Command-Line Interface
- Interactive gameplay with rich terminal visualization
- Visual board display showing ocean, submersibles, vessels, and resources
- Player status displays with resources, workers, and victory points
- Action selection menus with validation
- Beautiful end-game scoring display

### 3. AI Strategies
- **Random**: Makes random valid moves
- **Greedy**: Focuses on immediate resource gains and VP
- **Balanced**: Adapts strategy based on game phase
- **Aggressive**: Prioritizes rocket completion

### 4. Simulation System
- Run automated games with AI players
- Tournament mode to compare strategies
- Structured JSON logging of all game events
- Log analysis tools for extracting statistics

### 5. Comprehensive Unit Tests
- 100+ unit tests covering all major components
- Tests for resources, players, board, actions, game logic, and simulations
- Configured with pytest for easy test running

## Usage Examples

### Play an Interactive Game
```bash
# 3-player game
python main.py play --players 3

# With custom names
python main.py play --players 2 --names Alice --names Bob
```

### Run Simulations
```bash
# Run 100 games with mixed strategies
python main.py simulate --games 100 --strategies random,greedy,balanced

# Save results to file
python main.py simulate --games 50 --output results.json
```

### Run a Tournament
```bash
# Compare all strategies
python main.py tournament --strategies random,greedy,balanced,aggressive
```

### Analyze Results
```bash
# Analyze a log file
python main.py analyze logs/lineae_sim_20240101_120000.json
```

### Quick Test Game
```bash
# Quick simulation with visualization
python main.py quick --players 3 --strategy balanced
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=lineae

# Run specific test module
pytest lineae/tests/test_game.py
```

## Key Implementation Details

- **Modular Design**: Clean separation between game logic, UI, and AI
- **Type Hints**: Full type annotations for better IDE support
- **Error Handling**: Robust validation of all player actions
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new strategies or game variants
- **Well-Tested**: High test coverage ensuring reliability

The implementation faithfully recreates the Lineae board game experience while adding powerful simulation and analysis capabilities for studying different strategies.
