[x] While moving submersibles, there should be no Stay option.
[x] During the sunlight phase, players should gain 6 electricity, not 2, unless the sunlight is blocked by Jupiter.

[x] Mineral deposit tiles have 4 resources:  2 that dissolve into the ocean each round, 1 that you get during excavation, and 1 as a setup bonus.  Display them all appropriately in the Mineral Deposit table.
