[x] When visualizing the board, label each surface vessel with the player that owns it.
[x] MineralDeposits also have an excavation_type.  When excavating, 1 cube of this resource type is moved to the submersible's hold.

[x] When moving submersibles, use U(p) D(own) L(eft) and R(ight) as the options instead of numbers.
